Description: K2HDKC DBaaS Command Line Interface
 The K2HDKC DBaaS CLI (Command Line Interface of Database as a
  Service for K2HDKC) is a tool for building a K2HDKC cluster
  in conjunction with K2HR3.
  The Trove version of K2HDKC DBaaS is available, but this
  K2HDKC DBaaS CLI allows you to build K2HDKC clusters without
  the need for a Trove system.
  With the basic components of OpenStack and the K2HR3 system
  that works with it, you can easily build a K2HD KC cluster
  using the K2HDKC DBaaS CLI.
