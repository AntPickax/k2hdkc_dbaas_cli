The K2HDKC DBaaS CLI (Command Line Interface of Database as a
Service for K2HDKC) is a tool for building a K2HDKC cluster
in conjunction with K2HR3.
The Trove version of K2HDKC DBaaS is available, but this
K2HDKC DBaaS CLI allows you to build K2HDKC clusters without
the need for a Trove system.
With the basic components of OpenStack and the K2HR3 system
that works with it, you can easily build a K2HD KC cluster
using the K2HDKC DBaaS CLI.
